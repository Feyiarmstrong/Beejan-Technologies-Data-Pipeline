## Customer Complaints Data Pipeline – Beejan Technologies

## 1. Explanation of Diagram Flow

- Multiple sources feed into a single ingestion layer.  
- Ingestion handles both streaming (social media, real-time SMS) and batch data (call center logs, form submissions).  
- Cleaning & standardization ensures data quality and uniformity.  
- Enrichment & categorization classifies complaints (e.g., network, billing, service).  
- Storage separates raw and processed data for flexibility.  
- Serving layer provides analytics-ready access.  
- Orchestration & monitoring ensures reliability, error detection, and automated scheduling.  
- Data flows into DataOps environments (on-premises, cloud, or hybrid) from the orchestration and monitoring phase.

## 2. Detailed Overview

### Design Choices
- Centralized ingestion layer to unify all complaint channels.  
- Hybrid ingestion approach (batch + streaming) to accommodate different source frequencies.  
- Cleaning & standardization to remove duplicates, normalize formats, and handle missing values.  
- Complaint classification using structured categories to help downstream teams analyze trends.  
- Two-tier storage: raw data for audit and processed data for analytics.  
- Serving layer designed for fast querying and actionable insights for multiple teams.  
- Orchestration & monitoring ensures pipelines run reliably, with alerts for failures.  

### Assumptions / Thought Process
- Data sources vary in frequency: social media and SMS need near real-time processing; call center logs and web forms can be batch-processed daily.  
- All data can be represented in a structured or semi-structured format after cleaning.  
- Downstream users include management, reporting teams, and customer service, requiring both dashboards and reports.  
- Scalability is important because complaint volume is high and growing.  

### Challenges / Unknowns
- Volume and velocity of social media complaints may be unpredictable.  
- Data quality varies by source; some may require complex cleaning.  
- Classification may require ongoing refinement (e.g., new complaint categories).  
- Ensuring real-time data doesn’t overwhelm batch processes.  

### Other Information
- Pipeline is modular: sources, ingestion, processing, storage, serving, and orchestration are separable for future improvements.  
- Conceptually, the pipeline supports auditability (raw data), analytics efficiency (processed data), and actionable insights (classified complaints).
